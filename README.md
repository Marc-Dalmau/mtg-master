# MTG Master

MTG Master is an AI-powered platform for **Magic: The Gathering Commander** deck analysis, optimization, and deckbuilding.

The project focuses on helping players build stronger, more coherent Commander decks by combining structured deck analysis, power-level awareness, and AI-assisted guidance.

## What MTG Master Does

MTG Master provides tools designed specifically for the Commander (EDH) format, including:

- **AI-assisted deck analysis**
  - Evaluates deck structure (ramp, draw, interaction, protection, win conditions).
  - Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and consistency issues.
  - Considers archetype, commander identity, and table expectations.

- **Power-level and bracket awareness**
  - Uses defined Commander power brackets to align decks with real playgroup metas.
  - Helps avoid mismatched games caused by unclear power expectations.

- **AI Commander deckbuilding**
  - Assists with building or upgrading decks using AI guidance.
  - Supports both new decks and iteration on existing lists.
  - Designed to respect archetype intent rather than suggesting generic “good cards”.

- **Collection-aware optimization**
  - Helps players make better use of their existing card collections.
  - Highlights upgrade paths and optional improvements.

## Design Philosophy

MTG Master is built around the idea that Commander decks are **systems**, not just card lists.

The platform emphasizes:
- Context over raw card popularity.
- Clear structure instead of opaque scores.
- Long-term consistency and playgroup alignment.
- AI as a support tool, not a replacement for player creativity.
