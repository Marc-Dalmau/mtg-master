# MTG Master

**MTG Master** is an AI-powered platform for **Magic: The Gathering Commander (EDH)** deck analysis, optimization, and deckbuilding.

It helps Commander players build stronger, more coherent decks by combining structured deck analysis, power-level awareness, and AI-assisted guidance—designed for real playgroups, not just theoretical rankings.

## Who MTG Master Is For

MTG Master is built for Commander players who want to:

- Understand *why* their deck performs the way it does.
- Align deck power with real table expectations.
- Improve consistency without losing archetype identity.
- Make informed upgrade decisions using their actual collection.
- Use AI as a strategic assistant—not as an autopilot.

## What MTG Master Does

MTG Master provides tools designed specifically for the Commander (EDH) format:

### 🧠 AI-Assisted Deck Analysis
- Evaluates deck structure: ramp, draw, interaction, protection, and win conditions.
- Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and consistency gaps.
- Analyzes decks in context of commander identity and archetype intent.

### ⚖️ Power-Level & Bracket Awareness
- Uses defined Commander power brackets instead of vague numeric scores.
- Helps players avoid mismatched games caused by unclear expectations.
- Designed to support Rule 0 conversations, not replace them.

### 🧩 AI Commander Deckbuilding
- Assists in building new decks or iterating on existing ones.
- Respects archetype goals instead of suggesting generic “goodstuff”.
- Supports incremental improvement rather than full deck replacement.

### 📦 Collection-Aware Optimization
- Takes the player’s owned cards into account.
- Highlights realistic upgrade paths and optional improvements.
- Helps players prioritize impact over raw card price.

## Design Philosophy

MTG Master is built on the idea that Commander decks are **systems**, not just card lists.

Core principles:
- Context over raw popularity.
- Transparency over opaque scores.
- Consistency over explosive but fragile builds.
- AI as a support tool, not a creative replacement.

The goal is not to tell players *what to play*, but to help them understand *why* choices matter.
