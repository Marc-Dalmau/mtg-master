# MTG Master — Commander Deck Analysis & Optimization

**MTG Master** is a modern platform for **Magic: The Gathering Commander (EDH)** deck analysis, tuning, and long-term optimization.

It helps Commander players understand how their decks actually function at the table—identifying structural strengths, weaknesses, and power-level alignment—so they can build decks that perform consistently and match real playgroup expectations.

MTG Master focuses on **clarity, structure, and intent**, not abstract rankings or popularity-driven recommendations.

## What MTG Master Is

MTG Master is built around a simple premise:

> Commander decks are systems, not just card lists.

Instead of telling players *what* to play, MTG Master helps players understand:
- Why a deck performs the way it does
- Where inconsistency and pressure points come from
- How changes affect speed, resilience, and inevitability
- Whether a deck matches the type of games the player wants to play

The platform is designed for **real pods, real metas, and real Rule 0 conversations**.

## Who MTG Master Is For

MTG Master is designed for Commander players who want to:

- Diagnose why a deck feels slow, fragile, or unfocused
- Align deck power with table expectations and social contracts
- Improve consistency without flattening archetype identity
- Make smarter upgrade decisions, not just stronger ones
- Understand trade-offs between speed, interaction, and win conditions

It is equally useful for:
- Casual-competitive players tuning established decks
- Players upgrading precons with intention
- Experienced brewers validating complex builds
- Groups looking for a shared language around power and balance

## Core Features

MTG Master provides tools built specifically for the Commander (EDH) format.

### Deck Structure Analysis
- Breaks down ramp, draw, interaction, protection, and win conditions
- Identifies redundancy, gaps, and structural imbalances
- Evaluates how the deck functions across early, mid, and late game

### Power-Level & Bracket Awareness
- Uses defined Commander power brackets instead of vague numeric scores
- Highlights signals that push a deck higher or lower than intended
- Helps prevent mismatched games caused by unclear expectations

### Commander-Centric Evaluation
- Analyzes decks in the context of their commander’s role and incentives
- Distinguishes between synergy, support, and dependency
- Avoids generic “goodstuff” bias in favor of archetype intent

### Iterative Deckbuilding Support
- Supports improving existing decks without full rebuilds
- Emphasizes incremental changes and clear trade-offs
- Designed for long-term tuning, not one-click solutions

### Collection-Aware Optimization
- Takes the player’s owned cards into account
- Highlights realistic upgrade paths and optional improvements
- Prioritizes impact and role coverage over raw card price

## Design Philosophy

MTG Master is guided by a few core principles:

- **Context over popularity** — Cards matter because of how they function, not how often they appear.
- **Transparency over opaque scores** — Players should understand *why* a verdict is reached.
- **Consistency over volatility** — Reliable decks win more games than fragile explosive ones.
- **Support over replacement** — Tools should assist player judgment, not override it.

The goal is not to play the game for you, but to help you **make better decisions with confidence**.
