# Commander Brackets Explained

Commander brackets are a structured way to classify **Magic: The Gathering Commander (EDH)** decks based on *intent*, *consistency*, and *table expectations*.

They exist to make **Rule 0 conversations easier, faster, and more honest**—not to replace them.

Rather than asking “What power level is your deck?”, brackets answer a better question:

> **What kind of game is this deck trying to play, and how reliably does it do so?**

## Why Commander Brackets Exist

Traditional numeric power levels (e.g. “7/10”) are vague, subjective, and often misleading.

Commander brackets solve this by:
- Defining **clear intent-based categories**
- Setting **shared expectations before the game starts**
- Reducing mismatches caused by hidden combos or speed differences
- Creating a common language across playgroups, stores, and events

Brackets are not about judging decks—they are about **aligning experiences**.

---

## How Brackets Work

Each bracket represents a combination of:
- **Deck intent** (what the deck is trying to do)
- **Consistency** (how often it does it)
- **Speed and inevitability**
- **Use of tutors, combos, and game-warping effects**

Brackets are **ordinal**, not scores.  
A higher bracket is not “better”—it simply reflects a different play environment.

## The Five Commander Brackets

### Bracket 1 — Exhibition

**Intent:** Casual, expressive, and experimental  
**Games:** Long, swingy, social  

Typical characteristics:
- No infinite combos
- No extra turns
- No hard locks or game-ending engines
- Minimal tutoring
- Flavor- or theme-first builds

Common use cases:
- New players
- Theme decks
- Teaching Commander
- Social or narrative-focused games

---

### Bracket 2 — Core

**Intent:** Precon-level or lightly modified decks  
**Games:** Slower, interactive, board-focused  

Typical characteristics:
- Mostly preconstructed decks or light upgrades
- Few tutors, if any
- No fast combos
- Win conditions are usually combat-based
- Games tend to go long

Common use cases:
- Casual pods
- Newer playgroups
- Low-pressure store play

---

### Bracket 3 — Upgraded

**Intent:** Optimized casual play  
**Games:** Focused, consistent, but not explosive  

Typical characteristics:
- Clear game plan and archetype
- Some tutors or synergy engines
- Limited number of high-impact cards
- Combos may exist, but are slow or fragile
- Increased consistency without full optimization

Common use cases:
- Regular playgroups
- Tuned personal decks
- Casual competitive environments

---

### Bracket 4 — Optimized

**Intent:** High-power Commander  
**Games:** Fast, efficient, and decisive  

Typical characteristics:
- Strong tutors and redundancy
- Powerful synergies and compact win conditions
- Combos are expected and reliable
- Mana efficiency and interaction are prioritized
- Minimal “pet cards”

Common use cases:
- Competitive casual pods
- High-power LGS metas
- Players who want tight, skill-testing games

---

### Bracket 5 — cEDH

**Intent:** Maximum competitive efficiency  
**Games:** Fast, technical, and metagame-driven  

Typical characteristics:
- Fully optimized lists
- Fast mana and dense interaction
- Compact, resilient win conditions
- Heavy use of tutors
- Decks are built to win, not to express theme

Common use cases:
- Dedicated cEDH pods
- Competitive events
- Players who enjoy high-stakes optimization

## Important Clarifications

### Brackets Are About Intent, Not Just Cards
A single powerful card does not automatically raise a deck’s bracket.  
What matters is **how the deck is built and how consistently it executes its plan**.

### Brackets Do Not Replace Rule 0
Brackets are a starting point.  
They make conversations easier, but **exceptions and nuance still matter**.

### Brackets Are Not Moral Judgments
No bracket is “better” than another.  
A great Bracket 2 game is not inferior to a Bracket 4 game—they are simply different experiences.

## How MTG Master Uses Brackets

MTG Master uses commander brackets as a **context layer** for deck analysis.

Brackets help the platform:
- Evaluate decks relative to their intended environment
- Avoid misleading comparisons across incompatible playstyles
- Suggest improvements that respect a deck’s goals
- Flag inconsistencies between intent and execution

The goal is alignment—not escalation.

---

## Final Thought

Commander works best when everyone at the table wants the **same kind of game**.

Brackets provide a shared language to make that happen—clearly, honestly, and without friction.
